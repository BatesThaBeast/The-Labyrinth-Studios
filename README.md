# The-Labyrinth-Studios
Hello World!
This is the repo belonging to The Labyrinth Studios, a group of 8 individuals that was created at California State University of San Bernardino for the purpose of completing a Software Engineering project. For our project, we decided to make a 2d top dungeon crawling video game similar to the Legend of Zelda, a Link to the Past. Our project is called Marion, and has a basic story of a marionette trying to escape the evil rat plague doctor. 
The main purpose of this repo is to house this project and eventually at the closing of it remain as part of the team's resume.
